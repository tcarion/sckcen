## ADDER
Atmospheric Dispersion and Dose Equivalent Rates (ADDER) is a near-range atmospheric dispersion model including dose rate model.

## Description
ADDER uses meteorological and source term data to calculate ambient dose equivalent rates (nSv/h) due to the near-range atmospheric dispersion of radionuclides. It has been  developed as part of a PhD project on near-range atmospheric dispersion for use in impact studies. It was used to analyse a anomalous emission of selenium-75 in Belgium, 2019 (Frankemölle et al, 2022a) as well as for several routine emissions (Frankemölle et al, 2022b).

## Installation
ADDER was developed in https://www.anaconda.com/ so it does not come with a requirements file. However, only popular packages are used so it should be straightforward to run this code in a virtual environment.
